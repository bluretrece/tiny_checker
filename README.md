# Tiny type checker

In my effort of teaching myself type theory and PL design I decided to write a basic term type checker. The following is a small subset of lambda calculus that supports the following expressions:
* Abstractions
* Applications
* Add expressions
* Integers
* Variables
* If expressions
* True and false expressions.

For now the following type primitives are supported: 
* Booleans
* Integers
* Functions

# Todo
[ ] Support polymorphic types.
[ ] Implement Hindley-Milner algorithm.
[ ] Implement a REPL.
[x] Add tests.
